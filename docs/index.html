    <h1>Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini - biography</h1>
</div>
    <div class="bio"> 
        <p>Lionel Messi was born into a working-class family. His father, Jorge Messi, worked in a steel factory, and his mother, Celia Cuccittini, worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. Messi had two older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and a sister, María Sol. From a very young age, Messi displayed an extraordinary talent for football. By the age of five, he started playing for Grandoli, a local club coached by his father. Soon after, he moved to Newell’s Old Boys, a Rosario-based club.</p>
      
        <p>At the age of 11, Messi was diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency (GHD), a medical condition that stunted his growth. His family could not afford the expensive treatment, which included daily injections. Several Argentine clubs, including River Plate, expressed interest in signing him but were unwilling to cover the medical expenses.</p>
        
        <p>At age 13, in 2000, Messi's life changed forever. FC Barcelona offered to cover his medical bills if he moved to Spain and joined their famed La Masia youth academy. Messi and his family made the move to Barcelona, and by 2003, Messi had made his first-team debut in a friendly match at the age of 16. He officially debuted for Barcelona's senior team in a competitive match on October 16, 2004, against Espanyol, becoming the youngest player to represent the club in an official competition at the time.</p>
      
        <p>Messi quickly gained attention with his dribbling skills, vision, and extraordinary goal-scoring ability. By the 2005-06 season, Messi had become a regular starter in the first team, alongside superstars like Ronaldinho.
           First La Liga Title: Messi won his first La Liga title in 2005-06.
           First Champions League Title: Barcelona also won the UEFA Champions League that same season.</p>
        <p>From 2008 onward, Messi’s career took off to unprecedented levels, under coach Pep Guardiola. He became the face of the club and began a long-lasting rivalry with Cristiano Ronaldo, creating one of the most talked-about individual rivalries in football history.</p>
        <p>  Ballon d'Or Wins: Messi won his first Ballon d'Or in 2009, and went on to win the award seven times (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019, and 2021), a record in world football.</p>
        <p>  Tiki-taka Era: Messi was an integral part of Guardiola’s "tiki-taka" system, leading Barcelona to four Champions League titles (2006, 2009, 2011, 2015), 10 La Liga titles, and numerous other domestic and international honors.</p>
        <p>By 2012, Messi set the record for the most goals scored in a calendar year, netting 91 goals, surpassing Gerd Müller's long-standing record of 85 goals.</p>
